# Athena Framework Documentation

## Summary

[Athena Framework](https://athenaframework.com) is Roleplay framework for GTA:V that is utilized by not FiveM or ragemp but the [alt:V platform](https://altv.mp). This is a full fledged framework similar to ESX that allows you to build a more robust game mode out without having to think about core scripts. This framework is built with TypeScript and tries to keep developers in mind for major implementations and extendability.

## Documentation

https://docs.athenaframework.com/

## Development Stack

* MongoDB (Database)
* TypeScript / JavaScript (Programming Language)
* Vue 3 (Frontend)
* Vite (Vue 3 Tooling)

_Using modern development tools for a modern framework._

## Purchase, Buy, and 7-Day Trial

License keys may be purchased from [Athena Framework](https://athenaframework.com).

_There is not a lifetime package for Athena._

## Why is it Open Source?

Unlike other servers and frameworks I believe in helping everyone as much as possible. Leaving Athena open source allows developers to learn a few things about the way the author of this repository thinks. Sharing is caring unless you don't support your care giver.

## Demo

Small demo server available for you to test the framework with Administrative capabilities. 

You can check that out using the alt:V client at [https://altstats.net/server/504](https://altstats.net/server/504)
