The job framework is what allows general purpose jobs to be created for your Roleplay Server. It's a very simple script that handles most waypoint orientated jobs and will fit most general purpose job opportunities such as delivery jobs, triggering major server events, etc.

## Limitations

The Job Framework is really meant for one-off jobs that solo players can use to earn money, or even embed complex systems where you stock things across the map. You will have to write the stocking system but the sky is the limit with the Job Framework.

So let me preface this by saying what it cannot be used for:

* An Arrest System
* A Medical System
* A 'Police' Job
* A 'EMS' Job

_The above are very complex systems that are not the audience for the job framework_

## General Purpose Tutorial

This video below will teach you how to script a basic job using the framework.

## Learn from Example

Obviously with the framework you can see some of the jobs written in the plugins section to get a better understanding of how to better utilize the system.

Check out the jobs in the following locations:

- `src/core/plugins/job-mule-delivery`
- `src/core/plugins/job-pizza-delivery`
